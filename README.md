# Halla

> Minimal Slack wrapper app

Halla is yet another "native" app for accessing your Slack teams. It tries to be more conservative with resources.

Halla is built on [nw.js], which takes less resources than [Electron][] (most other wrapper apps) or [MacGap][] (Slack official app).

Halla is a work-in-progress; sorry, no downloads available yet, but there will be soon!

[nw.js]: http://nwjs.io/
[Electron]: http://electron.atom.io/
[MacGap]: https://macgapproject.github.io/

## Config

Create a file called `~/.hallarc`. Add as many Slack teams here.

```dosini
[services.myteam]
name = My Slack
url = https://myteam.slack.com
```

## Starting

Run it with `npm start`. Note that it'll download nw.js on its first run (pretty big).

```sh
npm start
```

Or run it with the SDK (more resource-intensive, but has *Inspect Element*):

```sh
npm run start:sdk
```

## Packaging

This will create OSX `.app` files in `/dist`.

```sh
npm run dist
```
